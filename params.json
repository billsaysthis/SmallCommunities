{"name":"SmallCommunities","body":"## Welcome to Small Communities\r\n\r\nSmall Communities is an application built on Ruby on Rails to drive websites \r\nfor small groups. The central concepts of the app are Members and Events with \r\nSpeakers. An administrator backend is provided through the RailsAdmin gem.\r\n\r\nEvents are available directly as well as on an upcoming calendar and a listing \r\nof past events. Members can RSVP for events and non-members can purchase \r\ntickets. A Memberships page provides links for purchasing annual memberships.\r\n\r\nPurchases are through (simple) PayPal Buy Now buttons and memberships by definition \r\ninclude admission to regular events.\r\n\r\nThere are also facilities for simple \"static\" pages, such as About and Contact.\r\n\r\n## Technical Overview\r\n\r\nSmall Communities uses Rails 3.1; Rails 2 support is precluded by use of certain \r\nframework methods and gems not available in Rails 2.\r\n\r\n### Core gems\r\n\r\n* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for authentication\r\n* [Compass](http://compass-style.org), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [Haml](http://haml-lang.com) for views and programmable CSS\r\n* [jQuery Rails](https://github.com/indirect/jquery-rails) to provide jQuery-based JavaScript helpers\r\n* [IceCube](https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube) and [iCalendar](http://icalendar.rubyforge.org/) for calendaring\r\n* [RailsAdmin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin) for automatic admin backend\r\n* [RSpec](http://rspec.info) and [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) for tests\r\n* [Configatron](https://github.com/markbates/configatron) for configuration file support\r\n* [Rack-Recaptcha](https://github.com/achiu/rack-recaptcha) for repatchas\r\n* [simple-navigation](https://github.com/andi/simple-navigation) for the Navigation menu\r\n* [Superfish](http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish) navigation menu JavaScript\r\n* [jTweetsAnywhere](http://thomasbillenstein.com/jTweetsAnywhere/) for displaying tweets\r\n* [Apprise](http://thrivingkings.com/apprise/) for better JavaScript dialogs\r\n* [Cantarell font](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Cantarell) by Abattis Fonts from [FontSquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/)\r\n\r\n### Theming and Text Customization\r\n\r\nIn order to easily customize appearance to match a group's visual branding, \r\nSmall Communities has a skin system.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Small Communities uses Rails' I18N facilities to manage strings \r\ndisplayed so you may edit the provided English file and add other languages as \r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nClone the SmallCommunities GitHub repo:\r\n\r\n<pre>   git clone git://github.com/billsaysthis/SmallCommunities.git</pre>\r\n\r\nOne of the gems, linecache19 (used by ruby-debug), doesn't install properly through Bundler, not clear why. \r\nThe workaround is to install it manually first, so this step is only necessary if linecache19 \r\nisn't already on your machine:\r\n\r\n<pre>   gem install linecache19 --no-ri --no-rdoc</pre>\r\n\r\nChange to the app directory and install the bundle:\r\n\r\n<pre>   cd small_communities\r\n   bundle install</pre>\r\n\r\nInstall plugins\r\n\r\n<pre>   git submodule init\r\n   git submodule update</pre>\r\n\r\nSetup and create the database, run the migrations:\r\n\r\n<pre>   edit config/database.yml\r\n   rake db:create\r\n   rake db:migrate</pre>\r\n\r\nEdit the English locale file, or prepare the one for your language:\r\n\r\n<pre>   edit config/locales/en.yml</pre>\r\n\r\n_Note:_ You may want to review the RailsAdmin and Devise locale files for your language.\r\n\r\nEdit the Mailer and AppConfig initializers:\r\n\r\n<pre>   edit config/initializers/sc_mailer.rb\r\n   edit config/initializers/app_config.yml</pre>\r\n\r\nEdit the seeds file and run the rake task:\r\n\r\n<pre>   edit db/seeds.rb\r\n   rake db:seed</pre>\r\n\r\n_Note:_ The About and Memberships page titles make use of the locale file\r\n\r\n### Confirm a valid install:\r\n\r\nStart the Rails server and load the app in your browser:\r\n\r\n<pre>   rails s\r\n   http://localhost:3000</pre>\r\n\r\n### Customize Appearance and Finetune Settings\r\n\r\n* Customize your theme by editing the SCSS files in app/stylesheets\r\n* Review the basic settings in the Settings tab of the Admin backend\r\n* Edit/create your \"static\" pages in the Pages tab of the Admin backend\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\n- Bill Lazar [billsaysthis](http://github.com/billsaysthis) - maintainer\r\n- Steve Morris [stevemorris](http://github.com/stevemorris)\r\n\r\n### Note on Patches/Pull Requests\r\n \r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Make your feature addition or bug fix.\r\n* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a\r\n  future version unintentionally.\r\n* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.\r\n  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)\r\n* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n\r\n#### Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Bill Lazar, [http://billlazar.com](http://billlazar.com).
